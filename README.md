# Project
Worked in a team of 4 to construct a manipulator with 2 degrees of freedom to move objects based on the color detected. Designed a servo mechanism using Arduino to achieve an electromagnetic grip to pick detected objects on the basis of color. Assembled an infrared sensor to control the motor drive for a manipulator to locate objects according to the color detected.
